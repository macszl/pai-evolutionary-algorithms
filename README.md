# Evolutionary Optimization with Maven + Java
This project implements various evolutionary optimization algorithms and tests them on different optimization functions. The project is built using Maven and Java.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this project:

- **Java 8 or higher**
- **Maven**

## Algorithms

The following evolutionary optimization algorithms are implemented in this project:

- Genetic Algorithm (GA)

- Differential Evolution (DE)

Each algorithm has its own main class and can be run separately.

## Optimization Functions
The following optimization functions are used to test the algorithms:

- Sphere Function

- Rosenbrock Function

Each optimization function has its own class and can be used by the algorithms.

## Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

- Clone the project using the command below:

git clone https://https://github.com/macszl/pai-evolutionary-algorithms.git

- Compile and run the project
